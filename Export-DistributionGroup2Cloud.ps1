      .SYNOPSIS
      Function to convert/migrate on-premises Exchange distribution group to a Cloud (Exchange Online) distribution group

      .DESCRIPTION
      Copies attributes of a synchronized group to a placeholder group and CSV file.
      After initial export of group attributes, the on-premises group can have the attribute "AdminDescription" set to "Group_NoSync" which will stop it from be synchronized.
      The "-Finalize" switch can then be used to write the addresses to the new group and convert the name.  The final group will be a cloud group with the same attributes as the previous but with the additional ability of being able to be "self-managed".
      Once the contents of the new group are validated, the on-premises group can be deleted.

      .PARAMETER Group
      Name of group to recreate.

      .PARAMETER CreatePlaceHolder
      Create placeholder DistributionGroup with a given name.

      .PARAMETER Finalize
      Convert a given placeholder group to final DistributionGroup.

      .PARAMETER ExportDirectory
      Export Directory for internal CSV handling.

      .EXAMPLE
      PS> Export-DistributionGroup2Cloud -Group "DL-Marketing" -CreatePlaceHolder

      Create the Placeholder for the distribution group "DL-Marketing"

      .EXAMPLE
      PS> Export-DistributionGroup2Cloud -Group "DL-Marketing" -Finalize

      Transform the Placeholder for the distribution group "DL-Marketing" to the real distribution group in the cloud

        From the original Script Author

        Name:        Recreate-DistributionGroup.ps1

        Version:     1.0

        Description: Copies attributes of a synchronized group to a placeholder group and CSV file.
        After initial export of group attributes, the on-premises group can have the attribute "AdminDescription" set to "Group_NoSync" which will stop it from be synchronized.
        The "-Finalize" switch can then be used to write the addresses to the new group and convert the name.  The final group will be a cloud group with the same attributes as the previous but with the additional ability of being able to be "self-managed".
        Once the contents of the new group are validated, the on-premises group can be deleted.

        Requires:    Remote PowerShell Connection to Exchange Online
